**Slow Motion** panel applies a time-scale effect to existing animation starting from a chosen frame. Instead of manually stretching keyframe ranges on many F‑Curves, it automatically slows down (or speeds up) a segment of motion while keeping animation before and after that segment intact.

## Settings and Controls

- **Start Frame**  
  The frame at which the slow-motion effect begins. Keyframes before this frame are not touched; keys from this frame onward are candidates for time scaling inside the slow-mo window.

- **SlowMo Length (s)**  
  Duration of the slow-motion effect in **seconds**, converted internally using the current scene FPS. This defines how long the slowed (or sped-up) segment lasts on the timeline starting from **Start Frame**.

- **Animation Speed**  
  The playback speed factor inside the slow-motion region:  
  - `1.0` means normal speed (no change).  
  - `0.5` makes animation 2× slower.  
  - Values below `1.0` slow it down, values above `1.0` make it faster. 

- **Round Keyframes**  
  When enabled, shifted keyframes are rounded to whole frames after scaling, avoiding fractional frame times that can appear when stretching animation based on FPS and seconds.

- **Fix Interpolation**  
  When enabled, all affected keyframes are set to **Bezier** interpolation after the slow-mo operation, which helps keep curves smooth if their interpolation was disrupted by the time scaling.

- **Apply Slow Motion**  
  The main action button. It scans selected objects, finds their animation, and scales keyframe times inside the slow-motion window according to **Animation Speed**, leaving keys before **Start Frame** and after the slow-mo end frame unchanged.

> **Note:** The slow-motion region is computed from the current scene FPS, the chosen **Start Frame**, and **SlowMo Length (s)**. Use this panel when you need precise, parameter-driven speed ramps (for example, half-speed hits or bullet-time moments) without manually scaling every curve in the Graph Editor.

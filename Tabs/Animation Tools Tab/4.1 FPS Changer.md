**FPS Changer** panel lets you retime animation when changing the scene’s frames-per-second value. Instead of your shots playing faster or slower after an FPS change, it rescales keyframe positions on selected objects so the motion keeps the same perceived duration at the new FPS.

## Settings and Controls

- **Use Current Scene FPS**  
  When enabled, the addon uses the current scene FPS as **Old FPS**. When disabled, you can manually type the **Old FPS** value to convert from.

- **Old FPS**  
  The source frame rate your animation was authored for (e.g. 24). Editable only when **Use Current Scene FPS** is off.

- **New FPS**  
  The target frame rate you want to retime the animation to (e.g. 60). Keyframes will be scaled so the motion keeps its timing at this FPS.

- **Scale from 1 frame**  
  When enabled, all keys in each action are scaled around frame 1 as the pivot, just like doing a Scale X in the Graph Editor with the cursor at frame 1. When disabled, the pivot is the earliest keyframe in that action, so the first key usually stays in place and only the keys after it are stretched or compressed.

- **Round Keyframes**  
  When enabled, retimed keyframe positions are rounded back to whole frames after scaling. This avoids fractional frame times that can appear when converting between FPS values that do not divide cleanly.

- **Fix Interpolation**  
  When enabled, all affected keyframes are set to **Bezier** interpolation after retiming. This helps restore consistent curve behavior if interpolation types were disturbed by the scaling.

- **Apply FPS Change**  
  The main action button. It scans all selected objects, finds their active actions, and rescales the timing of all F‑Curves according to the **Old FPS → New FPS** ratio (and optional multiplier), respecting the chosen pivot and rounding settings.

> **Note:** Only actions on **selected objects** are modified; scene FPS itself is not changed automatically. Use FPS Changer when you need to move a shot from one frame rate to another (for example, 24 → 60 FPS for gameplay or slow‑mo export) while preserving how long the motion feels on screen, instead of having it play faster or slower after the FPS change.
